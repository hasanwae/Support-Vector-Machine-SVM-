Iris Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica) using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (Support_Vector_Machine_(SVM).ipynb) using the Iris dataset (ir.csv).
Project Overview
The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the initial steps of building an SVM model to classify iris species based on four features:

Sepal Length: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
Sepal Width: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
Petal Length: Length of the petal in centimeters.
Petal Width: Width of the petal in centimeters.

The notebook includes data loading, exploration, and preprocessing steps, with plans to implement and evaluate the SVM model.
Dataset
The dataset (ir.csv) is the classic Iris dataset, containing 150 records with the following columns:

sepal_length: Float (4.3–7.9 cm)
sepal_width: Float (2.0–4.4 cm)
petal_length: Float (1.0–6.9 cm)
petal_width: Float (0.1–2.5 cm)
species: Categorical (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

Dependencies
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Install them using:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Run

Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-svm-classification.git


Ensure the dataset ir.csv is placed in the project directory or update the file path in the notebook.
Open the Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook Support_Vector_Machine_(SVM).ipynb


Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

Notebook Structure

Imports: Import required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
Data Loading: Load the Iris dataset (ir.csv) using pandas.
Data Exploration:
Display the first few rows with head().
Generate summary statistics with describe().
List unique species with unique().
Visualize feature relationships using seaborn.pairplot.


Preprocessing: Encode the target variable (species) using LabelEncoder.
Model Training (To be completed): Train an SVM model using SVC from scikit-learn.
Evaluation (To be completed): Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Next Steps

Complete the preprocessing by scaling features using StandardScaler.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets with train_test_split.
Train the SVM model and tune hyperparameters (e.g., kernel type, C value).
Evaluate the model performance using accuracy_score, classification_report, and confusion_matrix.
Visualize the decision boundaries or confusion matrix for better insights.
